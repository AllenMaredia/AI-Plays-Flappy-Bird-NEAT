# AI-Plays-Flappy-Bird-NEAT-

Using python I recreated the flappy bird game using the Pygame module and then used NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to create artificial neural networks to train a bird who can beat the game.

# Run
To watch the AI beat the game run the flappy_bird.py file.
